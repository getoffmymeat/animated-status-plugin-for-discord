# animated-status-plugin-for-discord
a python file that injects and uses open sourced code made by https://github.com/NullBytesx
I wanted to make the process simple for users to animate their status so I used ## Nullbytesx 
(https://github.com/NullBytesx/Simple-Status-Rotator) and made it easier for users to animate their discord status! Supports all STABLE discord installs/website as well just learn the concept of using it on the web instead of the app.
